# Agentic RAG Patterns Implementation

## Overview

Reference implementation of Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) using A2AJava, a structured Java agent framework. The implementation follows the design patterns introduced in the paper ["Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey on Agentic RAG"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09136), which explores how agent-based systems can improve the reliability, performance, and structure of retrieval workflows.

## What the Paper Proposes

The Agentic RAG paper introduces a more structured and selective approach to information retrieval and reasoning. While traditional RAG systems retrieve context from a vector database for every query and pass it to an LLM for response generation, Agentic RAG systems use intelligent agents to:

- Decide whether a query needs retrieval at all
- Choose which tools or actions to invoke
- Execute deterministic steps when possible
- Use LLMs or retrieval fallback only when necessary

The paper outlines several agentic control patterns including:
- Agentic Routing
- Tool Use
- Reflection
- Planning
- Multi-Agent Workflows

These patterns emphasize reducing hallucinations, lowering compute costs, and improving response speed by making agents responsible for selective control and execution.

## What is A2AJava?

[A2AJava](https://github.com/vishalmysore/a2ajava) is a Java framework for defining and invoking structured, deterministic agents. It is built on the Action-to-Action (A2A) protocol, which enables agents to declare actions, exchange JSON-compatible inputs and outputs, and collaborate using semantic memory and retrieval.

### Key Features

- Build both A2A and MCP compatible agents in Java, Kotlin, Groovy, and Scala
- Annotated Java methods as agent tools (`@Action`)
- Grouped agents via `@Agent`
- Prompt control using `@Prompt`
- Integration with vector databases for storing and retrieving semantically embedded content
- Optional fallback to LLM/RAG for open-ended inputs

A2AJava is well-suited to implement the Agentic RAG model because it focuses on structured action-based execution, not black-box generation.

## Agent Examples in the Reference Implementation

### 1. üß∫ WashingMachineManual Agent

This agent is responsible for storing and retrieving concise product usage instructions.

```java
@Agent(groupName = "washing machine", groupDescription = "documents related to washing machine operations")
public class WashingMachineManual {
    @Autowired
    private A2ARagService vectorService;

    @Action(description = "Store instructions for washing machine with model number")
    public String storeInstructionsForWashingMachine(
            @Prompt(describe = "not more than 10 lines of instructions") String instructions, 
            String modelNumber) {
        vectorService.storeData(instructions + "\n model number is " + modelNumber);
        return "Instructions stored for model: " + modelNumber;
    }

    @Action(description = "Retrieve instructions for washing machine with model number")
    public String retrieveInstructionsForWashingMachine(String modelNumber) {
        String instructions = vectorService.getSimilarDocuments(modelNumber)
                                        .get(0)
                                        .getFormattedContent();
        return (instructions == null || instructions.isEmpty())
            ? "No instructions found for model " + modelNumber
            : "Instructions: " + instructions;
    }
}
```

### 2. üßπ VacuumCleanerManual Agent

This agent functions similarly to the washing machine agent, but focuses on vacuum cleaner models.

```java
@Agent(groupName = "vacuum cleaner", groupDescription = "documents related to vacuum cleaner operations")
public class VacuumCleanerManual {
    @Autowired
    private A2ARagService vectorService;

    @Action(description = "Store instructions for vacuum cleaner with model number")
    public String storeInstructionsForVacuumCleaner(
            @Prompt(describe = "not more than 10 lines") String instructions, 
            String modelNumber) {
        vectorService.storeData(instructions + "\n model number is " + modelNumber);
        return "Stored successfully.";
    }

    @Action(description = "Retrieve instructions for vacuum cleaner with model number")
    public String retrieveInstructionsForVacuumCleaner(String modelNumber) {
        String instructions = vectorService.getSimilarDocuments(modelNumber)
                                        .get(0)
                                        .getFormattedContent();
        return (instructions == null || instructions.isEmpty())
            ? "No instructions found"
            : "Instructions: " + instructions;
    }
}
```

### 3. ‚öñÔ∏è LegalAgent

This agent exposes structured legal analysis tools such as compliance checking, clause summarization, and risk term detection.

```java
@Agent(groupName = "legal agent", groupDescription = "analyze and reason over legal clauses")
public class LegalAgent {
    @Action(description = "Summarize a legal clause")
    public String summarizeClause(@Prompt(describe = "clause to summarize") String clause) {
        // Call internal summarizer or vector DB summarizer
        return "Summary: ..." + clause;
    }

    @Action(description = "Check clause compliance")
    public String checkCompliance(String clause, String standard) {
        // Perform rule-based comparison
        return "Clause is compliant with: " + standard;
    }

    @Action(description = "Detect missing risk terms")
    public String detectMissingRiskTerms(String clause) {
        // Use local pattern matcher or embedding comparison
        return "Missing risk terms: liability, arbitration.";
    }
}
```

### 4. üç≥ RecipeAgent (Cooking Assistant)

An agent that stores cooking instructions and retrieves them by dish name, ingredient, or cooking method.

```java
@Agent(groupName = "recipes", groupDescription = "assist with storing and retrieving cooking recipes")
public class RecipeAgent {
    @Autowired
    private A2ARagService vectorService;

    @Action(description = "Store a recipe by name")
    public String storeRecipe(
            @Prompt(describe = "recipe steps") String steps, 
            String dishName) {
        vectorService.storeData(steps + "\n dish name: " + dishName);
        return "Recipe stored for: " + dishName;
    }

    @Action(description = "Retrieve recipe by name")
    public String retrieveRecipe(String dishName) {
        String steps = vectorService.getSimilarDocuments(dishName)
                                  .get(0)
                                  .getFormattedContent();
        return (steps == null || steps.isEmpty())
            ? "No recipe found for: " + dishName
            : "Recipe: " + steps;
    }
}
```
